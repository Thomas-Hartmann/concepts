### Study 30 min - enjoy 5 min break
To study for hours efficiently break it up with 5 min treats doing something you love. Do it 4-6 hours a day as early as you can. Then go out and enjoy your self: [Turn on a study lamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0) (that is any lamp that is dedicated to only that.) Turn it on and study. Turn it off when concentration starts to drop. 5 min break. Turn lamp back on etc.
